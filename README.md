## Note

Unfortunately the applet api I was using to generate this has been deprecated, and I have been unable to use this. I'll have to rewrite this.

### Run

If you do have the old Java dependencies, to run,
Compile them all
`javac Mandelbrot*.java`
To run choose a mandelbrot, for this one I'll choose #4 because it's my favorite
`appletview Mandelbrot4.html`
